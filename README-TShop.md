# How to add custom icons to TShop? (Work In Progress)

For TShop 3.1.0 and above.

## Attention
Please do not upload the vanilla icons. I have uploaded all vanilla item icons.

## Tutorial

### Server
If you don't have homemade server then please make one for the time of icon creating. The /renameitemicons command won't work on hosted servers because you generated the icons on your PC, not on ,,your" server.

### Unturned
1. Open Unturned
2. Go to workshop
3. Press Shift + F1
4. Generate All Icons (It will take a few minutes, do not close unturned)
5. Start your homemade server
6. Type /renameitemicons (It will take a few minutes, wait until it says "done")
7. You can found the icons in 'Your Unturned Folder/Extras/Icons'

### Github
1. Create your own repository.
2. Upload your icons into it. (Warning! You can upload maximum 1000 files per folder!)

### Plugin
1. Open the config file of TShop
2. (If you need) create a new GithubFolder (copy and paste)
3. Change the minimum and the maximum item ID.
4. Open an image on Github, Right Click, Click "Open Image on new window". Copy its link, but remove "imagename.png"
5. Paste that link as FolderLink into the config file
6. Save it
